# Pathfinding Visualizer

A (relatively) simple pathfinding visualizer built with js to learn more about the pathfinding algorithms. Implemented:
- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A* search

Inspired by: [Clement Mihailescu's pathfinding visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) and [Jeff](https://github.com/Jeffersonlii/Pathfinder)
